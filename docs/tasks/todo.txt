CSDT ToDo List

** High Priority **
1) Continue integrating JNLP and xml files for various projects into the system (JNLP File Modifications Needed)
   - Missing (MG, RW, WW)
   - Support (BD, BL, CC, GG, KC, SB)
   - WW xml file needs the project portion in xml filled with <project codename="WW" version="0.4" />
2) User profiles (with his uploads and images)
   - Change Email
   - Notifications
   - Favorite Projects
   - Friends
   - Comments
   - Add more information about themselves (member since, lasted logged in,...)
   - Default avatar images for user to choose
3) Delete button
4) Add a comments option for each project
   - Keep track of rating for each comment (likes)
   - Support reply for each individual comment
   - Limit the number of comments shown on the screen (like 20) - have a read all comments link for people to click if they so choose
5) Update user log whenever a user logs in and out
6) Create personalized thumbnail of each project


** Medium Priority **
1) If you click the teacher's username, you should be prompted to all of the classes that he/she manages
2) Stay on same page - remember the url you were previously at
  - Whenever someone clicks a link and is brought to a login screen, once they login, they should be brought back to that page, rather than home
  - After you upload, etc., stay on the same page
3) Determine whether a link is active or not using <li class="active"> to mark it. Determine what page you are currently on.
4) Support - place a link
5) Search functionality on the home page
   - Support searching of projects, classrooms, and users
6) Recently uploaded projects table
7) OP can make changes to their post or delete it
8) Limit the number of students that can participate in a classroom - 1000 users


** Low Priority **
1) https (ssl) for login
2) Create thumbnail of each project
3) Encrypt password using SHA-1 or SHA-2
4) Add a forum - use something already made
5) Add a blog - use something already made
  

** Security ** 
 - captcha - someway to hide private key
 - ssl (https)
 - javascript does the sha1
 - request for a site certificate
 - expiring cookies - place a timestamp and nonce to protect against someone tampering it


** CSDT - Overview **
1) Return success or failure to users on Ajax call. Needs to remember the state that they were entered in previously. 
2) More helpful messages on form validation
3) Better use of cookies to remember things as well as choosing better names
4) Active vs non-active users, projects, etc
5) Names of jqgrid tables - want it to be specific to user, like the user's first and last name, etc.
6) Get rid of alerts and place dialog boxes in its place
7) mako template file - thanks user for registering (Public Registration Part 1)
8) Do more thorough HTTP Error Checking
    - Only students registered in a class can see that class - check other users even if they are logged in


** Questions and Answers **
- Should an avatar image be added?
    Yes
- Should we keep track the number of times that a user has flagged certain messages
    No not necessary - but good to have
- Should we have a timestamp of when a user flags a message
    Yes
- When a comment is banned, what should we do with it? Should we remove it completely from the database?
    No
- Should we keep track of timestamp when we delete a project or user?
    Yes
- Do we need to know how many and who the people are who flagged the message
    Yes - to know who is spamming them
- Do we need to send a message out to the teacher to inform them that a message was flagged 
    Don't send them any email - allow them to switch out
- Delete - save project and user data or just remove it from database?
    1 Month for everyone
    Daily program that checks if one month passes for deleted project, remove it from server
- Should we allow users to change their username?
  - NO
- Should we allow teachers to change their class name?
  - NO
- Where should we send our comment flags to if there is no teacher? Who is the mediator?
  - Create a new group level called admin
  - Fake Admin 
- Should we allow a user to upload a project to multiple classes or to just one particular class?
  - Yes
- Continue integrating JNLP and xml files for various projects into the system (JNLP File Modifications Needed)
   - Missing (FQ, MG, RW, WW)
   - Support (BD, BL, CC, GG, KC, SB)
   - WW xml file needs the project portion in xml filled with <project codename="WW" version="0.4" />
- Should the flag comment level affect all classrooms that a user owns? Or just a particular one?
   - Individual
- If user is part of other classes, should their projects be visible by all classes or just the ones of their choosing?
   - have a setting which allows the user the choice of priviledges they want for their project
- When someone deletes a class, should i completely remove it from the database or have a visible column and keep the data still on the server?
   - downside is classname does not become available again...
   - rename deleted class (unique)
   - timestamp of delete
- Visible and non-visible stuff
   - Visible (Whether or not the item has been deleted)
   - Hidden (Hide users from being seen) - Default


** Work On **
1) Where should we send our comment flags to? Who is the mediator?
   - Create new group called mediators
   - Add user in the mediator group
2) For Flagged Comments Table - add timestamp of when each comment is flagged - not the time that the comment was actually created
3) If a project is deleted:
   - set active = 0 in the projects table
   - delete all entries of the project id from the project_stats table 
   - delete all entries of the project id from the project_ratings table 
4) Delete button
5) Comments 
   - Reply
   - Limit the number of comments shown on the screen (like 20) - have a read all comments link for people to click if they so choose
6) Notification and email functionality for users
7) Have a notification for whenever a teacher logins if there are flagged comments
8) Allow users to move projects in and out of various classrooms after they have been uploaded
9) Should galleries page show all classrooms available or only ones that are visible? (Visiblity indicates whether or not the classroom is viewable publically or only seen privately). Default - everything is currently always visible 
10) Some way for users to remove themselves from a class
11) Should create an option of whether or not a classroom teacher wants to monitor all comments (public teacher doesn't want to monitor anything)
    - Every class should have the option to change it
